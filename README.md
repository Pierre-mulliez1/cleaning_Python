# cleaning_Python
Data cleaning on finance datasets as a group 

## Instructions 

Your group task is to make a in class presentation of 7-13 minutes delivering a "lecture" of CLEANING DATA and DEVELOPING 2 MODELS using the RBA_KYC_Accounts_ALL_Ids.xlsx dataset in Python.

You can use as many Python libraries as you want, but you have to explain each library you use.

Your presentation should include:

A quick explanation of each library used, what it is for, who created and a little bit of its history. (less than a minute)
A quick Exploratory Data Analysis of the data set used.
Using the EDA, explain the problems of data quality in the data set.
Research about data preparation with Python. Propose and implement ways to clean, input missing and prepare the data for modeling. (YOUR PRESENTATION SHOULD FOCUS IN THIS PART - SHOULD BE ABOUT DATA CLEANING AND DATA PREPARATION)
Then, develop one Regression model using rbaValue as target variable.  Remember to assess the model performance using an appropriate measure for regression. 
Then, develop one binary Classification model using Risk_Description setting Risk_Description = Low as 0 and else 1 (Medium or High). Remember to assess your model performance using a appropriate measure for classification.
ps. please, don't improve the model, you don't need to make a good one, simply do a quick one! This exercise is about explaining how to prepare the data for modeling in Python , not about making a good model .


DELIVERABLES: a zip file delivered in here (just one for the whole group)!

The zip file should include all codes (Python codes used in the presentation) and all datasets used the presentation ;-)
